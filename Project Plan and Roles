The GUI interface (): Alex
  •	There should be an initial loading screen to welcome players.

  •	A class that will contain the function for generating the values of the cryptocurrency.
The profit engine (): Michael
  •	A mechanism to keep track of the investments of the player, trades, and profit.

The graph:  Antoine
  •	The mechanism for plotting the graph of the cryptocurrency and the pausing and unpausing. 
  •	This should be integrated with the GUI.
  •	This should also include the analysis plots.


The after-game analysis:  ABDULRAHMAN
  •	This should include a sorting algorithm which will display the highest and lowest prices.
  •	There should also be min and max heaps to keep track of the prices throughout the game.
